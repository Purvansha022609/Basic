Write the program to print Hello World

** Theory**
Hello World programs are traditionally used to demonstrate how the coding process works as well as to ensure that a language or system is working properly. They are typically the first programs that new coders learn and even those with little to no programming experience can quickly and correctly execute Hello World.

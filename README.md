# **AIM**
Write the program to print Hello World

## **THEORY**
Hello World programs are traditionally used to demonstrate how the coding process works as well as to ensure that a language or system is working properly. They are typically the first programs that new coders learn and even those with little to no programming experience can quickly and correctly execute Hello World.

### ** ALGORITHM**
|01| #include <iostream>: This line includes the Input/Output Stream library, which provides functions like cout and endl for input and output operations.

|02| int main() { ... }: This is the main function of your C++ program. It is the entry point of your program, and execution begins here.

|03| std::cout: This is the standard C++ output stream, which is used to display output on the console.

|03| "Hello, World!": This is the text you want to print. It is enclosed in double quotation marks to represent a string.

|04| <<: This is the output stream operator, used to insert the string "Hello, World!" into the std::cout stream.

|05| std::endl: This is used to insert a newline character and flush the output buffer. It ensures that "Hello, World!" is displayed on a new line.

|06| return 0;: This line indicates the successful completion of the main function. In C++, it's a convention to return 0 to indicate a successful execution of the program.

|07| Compile and run this code, and it will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
